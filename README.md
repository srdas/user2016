More Than Words: Text and Context, Language Analytics in Finance (joint useR2016 tutorial presentation on text mining with Karthik Mokashi)

The slides are in the HTML file; download and open it in any browser, it is too large to open from here, so downloading it is required. 

This is a talk I gave at Stanford in June 2016. The Rmd file contains all the code 
needed to execute all examples, and also generate the slides for the talk. The remaining
files are required for some of the examples in the program code.
